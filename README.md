# Mon-MHC

## About
**Mon-MHC** is a predictor of the MHC-I-peptide binding affinity based on the exploration of the energy landscape of complexes through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

It was developed during my Bioinformatics Master Thesis (UPF): *Development of an MHC-I-peptide binding predictor using Monte Carlo simulations (Vallejo-Vall√©s et al. 2023)*.

The project was carried out while being a Master Student at the research group *Electronic and Atomic Protein Modeling*, under the supervision of Dr. Victor Guallar at the *Barcelona Supercomputing Center*.
